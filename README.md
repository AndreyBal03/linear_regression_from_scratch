# Linear regression from scratch

This is a simple model of linear regression, that I create by myself using math.
It only needs numpy for matrix handle.

The class model, is able to work with n inputs and m outputs, without any problem.

The fit method is performed by using gradient descent and the loss function "Mean Square Error".
